Comma separated list of allowed instance types for spot requests,

    Controls whether AutoSpotting should allow parallel instance replacements

    Controls whether AutoSpotting considers EBS Bandwidth when comparing

  description = <<EOF
Controls whether or not to run AutoSpotting within a time interval
given in the 'autospotting_cron_schedule' parameter. Setting this to 'off'
would make it run only outside the defined interval. This is a global value
that can be overridden on a per-AutoScaling-group basis using the
'autospotting_cron_schedule_state' tag set on the AutoScaling group

Example: 'off'
EOF

variable "autospotting_cron_schedule" {
  description = <<EOF
Restrict AutoSpotting to run within a time interval given as a
simplified cron-like rule format restricted to hours and days of week.

Example: '9-18 1-5' would run it during the work-week and only within
the usual 9-18 office hours.

This is a global value that can be
overridden on a per-group basis using the 'autospotting_cron_schedule'
tag set on the AutoScaling group. The default value '* *' makes it run
at all times.
EOF
  default     = "* *"
}

variable "autospotting_cron_timezone" {
  description = <<EOF
Sets the timezone in which to check the CronSchedule.

Example: If the timezone is set to 'UTC' and the CronSchedule is '9-18 1-5'
 it would start the interval at 9AM UTC, with the timezone set to 'Europe/London'
it would start the interval at 9AM BST (10am UTC) or 9AM GMT (9AM UTC)
depending on daylight savings.

EOF

variable "autospotting_disable_instance_rebalance_recommendation" {
  description = <<EOF
  Disables the handling of instance rebalancing events, only handling the 2 minute
  termination events.

  Pros:
  - handling these give earlier instance replacements than the usual 2 minute notice,
    typically between 5-10 minutes.
  - they allow the execution of termination lifecycle hooks.

  Cons:
  - These events fire for all instances in a given capacity pool and have been seen
    to cause multiple parallel instance replacements on groups with multiple instances
    per AZ.
  - sometimes the instances aren't terminated, resulting in extra churn.

  Recommendation: set to true(disabled) on large groups, which have multiple Spot
  instances per AZ, to avoid multiple instance replacements in parallel.

    Controls the ordering of instance types when using the capacity-optimized-prioritized
    Spot allocation strategy. By default, using the 'lowest_price' bias it sorts instances by
    Spot price, giving a softer preference than the 'lowest_price' Spot allocation strategy.
    Alternatively, you can prefer newer instance types by using the 'prefer_newer_generations'
    bias, which still orders instance types by price but penalizes instances from older
    generations by adding 10% to their hourly price for each older generation when considering
    them for the sorted list. For example, a C5 instance type will be penalized by 10% over C6i,
